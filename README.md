# Applauz assessment

Requirements:
- [x] Build an API service in Node. Its purpose would be to manage user accounts.
        You can build your own or choose any frameworks available such as Express
- [ ] There is no database required but the data should be persistent.
        I would suggest saving the data in-memory through JavaScript databases such as NEDB or using JSON documents.

- [ ] Endpoints:
    - [ ] Get a list of users with optional query parameters
    - [ ] Create a single or multiple users
    - [ ] There should be validation
    - [ ] There should be adequately structured responses and error handling
    - [ ] All requests would need API Key authentication (can be hardcoded)
    - [ ] Some documentation in your repo to explain how to run this service as well as how to use the endpoints would be appreciated
    - [ ] Bonus: unit testing
